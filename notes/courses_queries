1.Show all of the sections in department X.

    {
        GET: ["courses_dept", "courses_id"],
        WHERE: {
        IS: {
            "courses_dept": X
            }
        },
        ORDER: null, AS: 'TABLE'
    };

2.Show all of the courses in department X ordered by [the most failing students || the most passing students || average grade].
        {
            GET: ["courses_dept", "courses_id", Z],
            WHERE: {
            IS: {

                }
            },
            ORDER: { "dir": Y, "keys": [Z]},
            AS: 'TABLE'
        };

        X = department
        Y = UP/DOWN
        Z = courses_fail || courses_pass || courses_avg

3.Previous task, allow sorting by more than one field.
        {
            GET: ["courses_dept", "courses_id", Z1, Z2, ...],
            WHERE: {
            IS: {
                "courses_dept": X
                }
            },
            ORDER: { "dir": Y, "keys": [Z1, Z2,...]},
            AS: 'TABLE'
        };

        X = department
        Y = UP/DOWN
        Zi = courses_fail || courses_pass || courses_avg

4.Find all the sections taught by instructor Y.
        {
            GET: ["courses_dept", "courses_id"],
            WHERE: {
            IS: {
                "courses_instructor": Y
                }
            },
            ORDER: null,
            AS: 'TABLE'
        };

        Y = instructor

5.Show all of the key details for courses in the university with filters for course titles, department, and sizes.
{
            GET: ["courses_dept", "courses_id", "courses_avg", "courses_instructor", "courses_title",
                    "courses_pass", "courses_fail", "courses_audit"],
            WHERE: {
            IS: {
                "X": Y
                }
            },
            ORDER: null,
            AS: 'TABLE'
        };

        X = courses_dept || courses_titles || courses_size
        Y = variables
6.Previous task, allow filtering by more than one field concurrently.
    previous queries but with support for AND/OR...


NOTE:
The 'size' of course should be determined by the number of pass + fail students in its largest section.
The number of sections that need to be scheduled should be the number of sections in the last available year (2014) divided
by three and rounded up to the nearest integer (aka if the number was 0 it should be 1, if it was 2.1 it should be 3).
